/*
* DAO :- DAO stands for DATA ACCESS OBJECT.
*        This is basically an interface, which contains the methods like getData() or storeData() etc.. which are used for accessing the database.
*        This interface will be implemented by the Room.
*
* . To interact or say access we need an interface annotated with DAO. This is how Room figures out.
*   Each DAO includes methods that offer abstract access to your appâ€™s database.
*
* . By accessing a database using a DAO instead of a query builder or direct queries,
*   you can separate out different components of your database architecture.
*
* . DAO allows you to easily mock database access as your test app.
*
* . A DAO can be either an interface or an abstract class.
*   In case of an abstract class, it can optionally have an constructor that takes RoomDatabase as its only parameter.
*
* . Room creates each DAO implementation at compile time.
